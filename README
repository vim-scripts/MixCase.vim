1. Intoduction

This plugin does nothing very useful
it modifies words :
- in the hackers way (m¡x(ã$e)
- in the Cambridge way : it ceganhs the odrer of the lreetts which doesn't
              afceft the raitaeidbly vrey mcuh (when the wdors are not too lnog)

It now uses an ini file to customize the mi×ç4$3 table the way you want.
Eventually, you can have many ini files to swap between many types of
mI×ca5iÑG

No mapping is provided as you know better than me where you want to map your
commands. Another reason is that mapping is often used for useful commands which
is not the case here.

This plugin provides the following commands and functions : ~
To Mix ranges of text :
 :MCCambridge
 :MCHackerz

To Mix word under cursor and, eventually substitute all occurence :
 :MCHackerzMixWordUnderCurs
 :MCHackerzMixNSubstWordUnderCurs
 :MCHackerzMixSearchPattern
 :MCCambridgeMixWordUnderCurs
 :MCCambridgeMixNSubstWordUnderCurs
 :MCCambridgeMixSearchPattern

These commands are long to type to easily know what they do but you can map them :
for exemple, you can add
map <F2>   :MCHackerzMixWordUnderCurs<CR>
in your .vimrc


To use in \= expressions :
 function MixCase(...)
 function MixCambridge(...)

To manage ini file at runtime
 :MCSetIniFile
 :MCGoIniDir

Please, feel free to send me any comment. If you miss something (linked to
m;×¢4Z3, of course), I'd add it with pleasure.
If you are to vote -1, i'd be pleased to know what was wrong and what you were waiting for ;-)
